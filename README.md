Advanced Library Management System


Project Overview
The Advanced Library Management System is a software project designed to manage library resources, patrons, and transactions. It showcases a practical application of key software development principles, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, database design, SQL, and JavaFX for creating a modern, user-friendly interface.

This project provides an opportunity to develop and strengthen programming and problem-solving skills while simulating a real-world application.

Features
Resource Management: Manage books, journals, and other library resources.
Patron Records: Maintain details of library users and their activities.
Transaction Management: Handle book reservations, lending, and returns with stacks and queues.
Database Integration: Efficiently manage data with a normalized relational database.
Intuitive User Interface: JavaFX-powered responsive dashboard for seamless user interaction.

Technologies Used

Java: Core programming language with OOP principles.


JavaFX: Framework for creating a modern UI.


Data Structures: Linked lists, stacks, and queues for optimized operations.

Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.

JDBC: For database connectivity and SQL execution.

Project History and Challenges


Background:
This project was conceptualized as a hands-on learning tool to apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios.
It is structured into milestones, focusing on different aspects of software development, from OOP and data structures to database design and user interface integration.

Challenges:
Designing a normalized database schema that effectively supports all operations.
Implementing dynamic data structures like linked lists and ensuring their integration with the system's operations.
Bridging the gap between backend logic and the JavaFX user interface.
Ensuring robust error handling in JDBC connectivity and SQL execution.
These challenges helped build a deeper understanding of system design and debugging.

Installation and Setup

Prerequisites

Java JDK 8+ installed.

MySQL or PostgreSQL installed and configured.

JavaFX SDK.

An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Steps
Clone the repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-library-management-system.git

Set up the database by running the SQL scripts provided in the sql folder.

Update database configurations in the application.properties file.

Build and run the project in your IDE to launch the JavaFX application.

Usage
Dashboard: View total resources, patrons, and transactions.

Add Resources/Patrons: Use forms to add books, journals, or patrons.

Manage Transactions: Reserve, lend, and return resources using an intuitive workflow.

View Records: Display detailed lists of resources and patrons with search capabilities.
